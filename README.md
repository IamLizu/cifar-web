You can use the dumbest and remember able words to generate secret words(could be your passwords). Not an encryption algorithm though a little modification of Caesar Cipher(perhaps a stupid one).

However, this may or may not (higher chances) solve the password remembering issue. So, the implication of 'Password Manager' is not literal.

## Usage

1. At first, enter the string you want to generate your password with.
2. Then please select how many characters you want ot shift. Please not that this shifting is forward only and limited.

3. Now, press the generate button, a generated string will appear.
4. Finally, click the button to copy the string to your clipboard.
